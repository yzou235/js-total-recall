/*
1. How do we assign a value to a variable?
- Use "=" assignment operator.
2. How do we change the value of a variable?
- Reassign it using the assignment operator.
3. How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
- newVar = existingVar
4. Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
- Declare: The process of introducing a variable to the compiler or interpreter. It tells the compiler that the variable exists and specifies its data type but doesn't allocate memory or assign a value.
- Assign: The process of giving a value to a variable. It involves using the assignment operator to store a particular value in a variable.
- Define: the definition specifies the body for a function, associates an identifier with the function, and allocates storage for it.
5. What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
- Pseudocoding is the process of planning a computer program by writing a high-level description of its logic, structure, and flow using natural language rather than a specific programming language syntax. It helps in organizing thoughts before actual coding begins and serves as a roadmap for implementation. 
6. What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?
-  A common guideline is to spend a significant amount of time upfront on problem-solving, design, and planning (possibly 50-80%), and the remaining time on actual implementation.
